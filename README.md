# Insurance Claim Flag Prediction Model

# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for insurance claim flag prediction. Given a set of features related to insurance policyholders, such as their demographic information, driving history, and past claims, the model aims to predict whether a policyholder is likely to file an insurance claim in the future.

# Conclusion

After training and evaluating various machine learning models, we have identified the top features that contribute the most to predicting insurance claim flags. These features are crucial for understanding the underlying factors that influence claim behavior. The top 5 features and their importance scores, as determined by the Random Forest classifier, are as follows:

CLM_AMT: 0.6133
CLAIM_FREQ_AMT_RATIO: 0.2858
OLDCLAIM_INCOME_RATIO: 0.0199
URBANICITY_Highly Urban/ Urban: 0.0122
URBANICITY_Highly Rural/ Rural: 0.0081
These features provide valuable insights into the likelihood of insurance claims being filed. Leveraging these insights can help insurance companies optimize their risk assessment processes, leading to more accurate predictions and better decision-making.
